# Automated Video Creation Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to automate the process of creating YouTube videos by integrating GPT Assistant for text prompts, Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) for voice generation, RunwayML for video creation, and MoviePy for video and voice integration.

## Objectives
1. Develop an end-to-end automated system for video creation.
2. Ensure seamless integration of voice and video components.
3. Optimize the workflow for efficiency and reliability.

## Scope
- Manual input of text prompts; the system handles the rest.
- Output: Fully generated and merged YouTube-ready videos.

## Timeline

### Phase 1: GPT Assistant Integration (1 week)
- Set up and test OpenAI GPT API.
- Develop a system for sending and receiving prompts.

### Phase 2: Voice Generation with gTTS (1 week)
- Integrate Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) API.
- Test voice generation and refine as needed.

### Phase 3: Video Generation with RunwayML (2 weeks)
- Explore and set up RunwayML for video generation.
- Develop a pipeline to convert text prompts into video content.

### Phase 4: Video and Voice Integration (1 week)
- Use MoviePy to merge generated voice and video.
- Test integration and refine as needed.

### Phase 5: Testing and Optimization (2 weeks)
- Comprehensive testing of the entire automated process.
- Optimize for performance, accuracy, and reliability.
